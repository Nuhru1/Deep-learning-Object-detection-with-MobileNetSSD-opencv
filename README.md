In this project we are using the MobileNet SSD + deep neural network ( dnn ) module in OpenCV to build our object detector.

The MobileNet SSD was first trained on the COCO dataset and can detect 20 objects as we can see the differents classes below.

CLASSES = ["background", "aeroplane", "bicycle", "bird", "boat",
	"bottle", "bus", "car", "cat", "chair", "cow", "diningtable",
	"dog", "horse", "motorbike", "person", "pottedplant", "sheep",
	"sofa", "train", "tvmonitor"]
